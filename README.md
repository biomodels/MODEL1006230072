**Abstract:**   
The pacemaker activity of the S-A node cell was explained by reconstructing
the pacemaker potential using a Hodgkin-Huxley type mathematical model which
was based on the reported voltage clamp data. In this model four dynamic
currents, the sodium current iNa, the slow inward current, is, the potassium
current, iK, and the hyperpolarization-activated current, ih, in addition to a
time-dependent leak current, i1 were included. The model simulated the
spontaneous action potential the current voltage relationship, and the voltage
clamp experiment in normal Tyrode solution of the rabbit S-A node.
Furthermore, the changes of activity induced by the potassium current blocker
Ba2+, by applying constant current, acetylcholine, and epinephrine were also
reconstructed. It was strongly suggested that the pacemaker depolarization in
the S-A node cell is mainly due to a gradual increase of iS during diastole,
and that the contribution of iK is much less compared to the potassium current
iK2 in the Purkinje fiber pacemaker depolarization. The rising phase of the
action potential was due to iS and the plateau phase is determined by both the
inactivation of iS and activation of iK.
